#### How to use the course material

This is the easiest method and allows you to view the assignment descriptions offline. Be aware though that the online material may change. Check out the [commits list](https://github.com/MareinK/ru-ai-pacman/commits/master) to see whether anything has changed. If there are any significant changes, these will of course also be announced on Blackboard. Nonetheless, we recommend viewing the assignment descriptions online on GitHub.
